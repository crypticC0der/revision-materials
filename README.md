# revision-materials
my set of revision materials for A level computing, this includes flashcards and a program to read the flashcards<br>
<br>
there are few command line options for the python file, but one is wether or not it will read it and load the libraries neccicary for this<br>
if you want it to read the flashcard using text to speach use -v<br>
this is off by default<br>

<p>the cards data file stores over 1000 flashcards in the form:<br>
  card front/\card back\/<\p>
